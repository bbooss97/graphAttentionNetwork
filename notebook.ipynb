    "In the case of graph convolutional layer to produce the hidden representation of a node x we would apply a sort of message passing ,where there are parameters to optimize ,between the nodes x and its neighbors, and this operation is done in parallel in all the nodes. \n",
    "The nodes features are all stacked in a matrix and this matrix is used to derive the hidden features for all the nodes using a W matrix of learnable weights and the adiacency matrix.\n",
    "The weight matrix is where the learning takes place and could be described as a matrix or seen as a fully connected layer on the node embeddings.\n",
